       "[Document(metadata={'source': 'kb_en.txt'}, page_content=\"In the ancient kingdom of Hastinapura, a great epic was unfolding, one that would shape the destiny of the world and impart timeless lessons. This epic was the Mahabharata, a tale of conflict, duty, righteousness, and destiny.\\nThe story began with the Kuru dynasty, ruled by King Shantanu. Shantanu married to Ganga, the river goddess, and they had a son named Devavrata, later known as Bhishma. Bhishma took a vow of celibacy to ensure his father's happiness, allowing Shantanu to marry Satyavati, a fisherwoman. Satyavati bore two sons, Chitrangada and Vichitravirya. Chitrangada died young, and Vichitravirya became king. He married two princesses, Ambika and Ambalika, but died childless. To continue the lineage, Vyasa, Satyavati's son from an earlier union, fathered sons with the queens through Niyoga. Thus, Dhritarashtra, born blind, and Pandu, who had a pale complexion, were born.\\nDhritarashtra married Gandhari, who blindfolded herself to share her husband's blindness. They had a hundred sons, the Kauravas, with Duryodhana being the eldest. Pandu married Kunti and Madri. Due to a curse, Pandu could not father children. Kunti invoked divine boons to bear sons. She bore Yudhishthira from Dharma (god of righteousness), Bhima from Vayu (god of wind), and Arjuna from Indra (king of gods). Madri bore Nakula and Sahadeva from the Ashwini twins. These five were the Pandavas.\\nAfter Pandu's death, Kunti and the Pandavas returned to Hastinapura. Dhritarashtra, now the ruler, raised them alongside his own sons. The rivalry between the Kauravas and Pandavas grew intense, especially between Duryodhana and Bhima.\\nAs the princes came of age, Drona, a master of advanced military arts, was appointed their teacher. Arjuna, the third Pandava, became Drona's favorite due to his unmatched skills. Duryodhana's jealousy of Arjuna's prowess festered, sowing seeds of discord.\\nA significant event in their training was the tournament showcasing their skills. Arjuna dazzled the audience, but Karna, an unknown warrior, challenged him. Karna's origins were mysterious, but he was eventually revealed as Kunti's firstborn, abandoned at birth and raised by a charioteer. Despite his royal blood, his lowly upbringing fueled his resentment and desire to prove himself. Duryodhana, seeing an ally in Karna, crowned him king of Anga, solidifying their bond.\\nThe rivalry reached a boiling point when Duryodhana, through deceit, sent the Pandavas and their mother to a palace made of flammable materials. They narrowly escaped the fiery trap, living incognito in the forest. During this period, Arjuna won Draupadi's hand in marriage at her swayamvara (a ceremony of choosing a husband from among assembled suitors). Draupadi, through a misunderstanding, became the common wife of all five Pandavas, honoring their bond.\\nReturning to Hastinapura, the Pandavas were given half the kingdom, which they developed into the magnificent city of Indraprastha. Their prosperity only increased Duryodhana's envy. During a fateful game of dice, Yudhishthira lost everything, including his kingdom, brothers, and Draupadi, to Duryodhana. Draupadi was humiliated in the Kaurava court, an event that sowed the seeds for the great war.\\nAfter their exile and incognito period, the Pandavas sought their kingdom back. Diplomatic efforts failed, leading to the declaration of the Kurukshetra War, a battle of epic proportions between the Pandavas and Kauravas.\\nThe Bhagavad Gita, a sacred text, emerged from this war. On the battlefield, Arjuna was filled with doubt and sorrow about fighting his kin. Krishna, his charioteer and an incarnation of Vishnu, imparted profound spiritual wisdom, emphasizing duty, righteousness, and the impermanence of life.\\nThe war lasted eighteen days, with colossal losses on both sides. Bhishma, bound by his vow to protect the throne, fought valiantly but fell to Arjuna's arrows, guided by Shikhandi. Drona, tricked into believing his son Ashwatthama was dead, laid down his arms and was killed. Karna, learning of his true heritage, fought heroically but was ultimately slain by Arjuna.\\nOn the final day, Bhima fulfilled his vow by killing Duryodhana in a brutal duel, smashing his thigh. With the Kauravas defeated, the Pandavas emerged victorious, but at a great cost. The battlefield was a graveyard of warriors, including the heroic Abhimanyu, Arjuna's son, and Ghatotkacha, Bhima's son.\\nYudhishthira ascended the throne, ruling justly and wisely, but the victory was hollow. The elders, Bhishma, Drona, and Vidura, along with Krishna, imparted wisdom to Yudhishthira, guiding him through his grief and guilt. Bhishma, lying on his bed of arrows, gave profound teachings on statesmanship, duty, and dharma before his death.\\nThe story concluded with the Pandavas renouncing their kingdom, embarking on their final journey toward the Himalayas. Along the way, Draupadi and the brothers, except for Yudhishthira, fell, symbolizing their human flaws. Yudhishthira, accompanied by a dog representing dharma, reached the gates of heaven. Tested by Yama, the god of death, Yudhishthira's righteousness earned him a place in heaven.\\nThe Mahabharata, a timeless epic, encapsulated the complexities of human nature, the importance of duty and righteousness, and the inevitable cycle of life and death. It remains a source of spiritual and moral guidance, inspiring countless generations.\")]"
